description: "The Carleton Food Collective is a volunteer-run not-for-profit
  organization that started in 2001 as a response to food insecurity on campus.
  It has since expanded to address food security in the broader community and
  established a base of operations with a meeting space, commercial kitchen, and
  garden, the Garden Spot (or the G-Spot as it's fondly known). The Collective
  aims to promote food security by encouraging people to engage with and think
  about all parts of the food system: production, preparation, distribution,
  consumption, and disposal. Through this engagement, volunteers find
  sustainable alternatives to explore with the focus being on how we can take
  direct action to immediately create alternative ways of living within our
  community. Everyone needs to eat and so everyone has a connection to food
  security in some way. The collective centers this shared need in its
  organizing to operate around the principle of mutual-aid and consider the work
  it does not as an act of charity but as work that benefits the Collective and
  its members as part of the community."
